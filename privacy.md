**tl;dr**: Host your images/videos/audio [here](https://mediacru.sh). We're more privacy-concious than imgur,
minus, YouTube, etc.

A lot of people have taken steps to [opt-out of Prism](http://prism-break.org) and other government surveillance
programs, but have you considered where you're hosting your media? Where do you upload your images and gifs?
Where do you share your audio files and videos from? If the answer is imgur, minus, YouTube, etc... none of these
websites have a strong commitment to your privacy.<sup><a href="http://imgur.com/tos">[1]</a>

It's amazing how much websites store about us these days. But there is a solution - use MediaCrush instead.
We'll host your media for free, and we will not store any information about you.

* Every time you access our site, it's impossible to snoop on you. See that lock on your address bar?
* We respect your [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/) settings.
* We never, ever store anything about you. If the NSA seized our site, there'd be nothing there.
* Our site has ads, but you're always one click away from never seeing them again.
* We publish just about everything we do - financial reports, analytics, donations, everything.<sup><a href="https://mediacru.sh/transparency">[4]</a></sup>
* You can anonymously support our cause with Bitcoin.<sup><a href="https://mediacru.sh/donate">[5]</a></sup>
* MediaCrush is completly open source.<sup><a href="https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush">[6]</a></sup>
  That means that anyone can view our code.

Not only do we respect your privacy, but we're bloody fast, too.<sup><a href="https://mediacru.sh/demo">[7]</a></sup>
We also have a 25 MB upload limit - bigger than imgur and minus combined! Next time you post a cat gif to Reddit,
why not [give us a shot](https://mediacru.sh)?
