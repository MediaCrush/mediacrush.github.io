Starting today, you can now paste images into MediaCrush to upload them!

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://mediacru.sh/XuRNwTJUNiCO/embed"></script>

You can also paste direct links to images on other websites, and MediaCrush will download and
rehost them for you. We've also added a shortcut to help you embed our media in other websites:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://mediacru.sh/SvWOLlocHTWM/embed"></script>

Last of all, we've modified the appearance of ads at the request of some users. It should now
be more obvious that they are, in fact, advertisements. Feel free to chat with us about these
changes in the comments, or [via email](mailto:support@mediacru.sh). Thanks for using MediaCrush!
