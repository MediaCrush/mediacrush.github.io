As some of you may have noticed in our [July financial report](https://mediacru.sh/transparency/2013-08-01-Financial-summary.md),
we spent a little bitcoin on an infographic. Unfortunately, we didn't get the chance to really promote MediaCrush with it. We don't
want all that effort to go to waste, so, without further ado, here is the infographic:

We hereby release this infographic under the terms of the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Feel free to use it
yourself if you want to spead the word about MediaCrush!
