Greetings! I've prepared the last report of 2013, a little later than usual. Thanks for being patient! I'd like to extend a
special thanks to one very generous donor who single-handledly paid for nearly all of our operating costs this month. Thank
you!

In December, MediaCrush served media to 206,698 unique visitors, spread out over 367,420 page views. Most of them arrived on
Chrome, and nearly all of them came from Reddit.

Please note that this month, we have made some changes that affect reporting.

* We have [removed advertising](https://blog.mediacru.sh/2013/12/02/Removing-advertisements.html) from MediaCrush, and thus
  we are no longer reporting adsense revenue
* We moved from AWS to Voxility this month for hosting, which has a number of implications:
  * MediaCrush hosting now has a fixed price of $199/mo, and we will not produce a unique report for hosting costs
  * The new server is located outside of the United States, which addresses the concerns of some privacy-concious users
  * Our dedicated Voxility server is capable of much faster processing and has much greater storage at a lower price
  * Speed is noticably affected in some regions coming off of the AWS CDN. We are working on a solution, stay tuned.
* The donation report is no longer included, and the information previously found there is available in each generic
  financial report.

Interesting reports are shown in bold.
