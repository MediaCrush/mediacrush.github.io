Hello! We've been a little behind on our reports again, I apologize for that. However, we have
today's report for you. There's one new expense to consider: Amazon CloudFront. We've been
experimenting with CDN solutions to serve media faster. We are able to turn CloudFront on and
off as need be to control expenses.

In January, MediaCrush served media to 149,658 people.

Interesting reports are shown in bold.
