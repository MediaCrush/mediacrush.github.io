title: Upload from your microphone
---

You may have noticed a little microphone icon on MediaCrush for the past few weeks. You might have
even clicked it, and if so, this article will tell you nothing new. For the uninquisitive among you:
we have added support for uploading audio directly from your microphone!

<div class="mediacrush" data-media="Jmw2OWrSoC-U"></div>

It's just that simple. You can make albums of your recordings, too, or include other media in the
album like pictures and video. It works just like uploading an audio file directly, only it skips
the middleman. You also get all the
[privacy benefits](https://blog.mediacru.sh/2013/07/19/MediaCrush-for-nerds.html) that come from
using MediaCrush in the first place.


And as always, thanks for using MediaCrush!
