title: Changing settings for uploaded media
---

Hi there! We deployed a quick update here at MediaCrush, just in time for Christmas.
Now, when you upload any video file (including GIFs!), you get the option to change
some settings on them!

This means that you can upload an actual video, turn on loop,
autoplay, and mute, and it'll work like a GIF. You can also turn off looping or
autoplay on GIFs, and we're getting ready to expand this stuff to support even more
options.

We hope you like it, and as always, thanks for using MediaCrush!
