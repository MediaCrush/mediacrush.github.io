title: Supporting all media formats
---

Starting today, MediaCrush supports **over 500** different media formats. This includes everything
we already supported and more. Some of my favorite new formats are lossless audio (like FLAC), and
more video formats (like MKV and WMV), or more vector graphics, and raw photographs. We'll also take
more kinds of audio, like raw PCM data. Odds are, for any particular media format, we'll support it.

A [whole lot of work](https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush/pull/449) went into this, and there
are lots of internal improvements as well. You should notice faster processing times and more
stability overall.

Enjoy uploading all the media you can think of, and thanks again for using MediaCrush!
