title: New and improved albums
layout: post

We pushed support for better albums this morning. The size limit for an album has been
raised to 1024 items per album, and we improved the UI as well to support larger
albums. Additionally, we've added a new album layout (switch with the buttons on the
top-right of any album), and opened the door for more to come. Speaking of which, if
you'd like to see some more layouts, why not flex your programming muscles and contribute
to the [open-source project](https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush)?

In other news, we're also trying out [Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/mediacrush/) for
donations, which is a platform for sharing money in the open-source community. Why not
share some love in the [Python community](https://www.gittip.com/for/python/)?

Enjoy the new albums, and as always, thanks for using MediaCrush.
