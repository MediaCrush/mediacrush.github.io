Hey guys! Quick blog post to let you know about an update we pushed - we have
rewritten our website with "CoffeeScript", and in doing so, made some better
choices than the first time we wrote it. Things won't feel much different, but
you should notice that the site is more snappy and interactive, and works
more consistently.

If you're a hacker, you might enjoy reading through the [new frontend](https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush/tree/master/scripts).

Oh, and sorry for the delay on December's transparency report. It's coming, I
promise, we're just a little behind.
