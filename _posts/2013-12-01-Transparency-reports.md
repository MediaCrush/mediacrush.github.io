title: Transparency Reports for November 2013
layout: post
---

Hey guys! Record breaking month here at MediaCrush. We've made double our previous ad revenue (thanks for turning off adblock,
it helps a lot). We also hit a new record for daily uniques - there were 20,314 uniques yesterday. We've also switched hosts.
We are no longer hosted on AWS - we're on Voxility now. Our hosting is cheaper and much more powerful, on a burly 8 core machine
that does GIF and video processing much faster. We also pay less for it, and it's not in the US, for some privacy-related
peace of mind. We also lost less money this month than every other - we're approaching sustainability. Here's this month's reports:
