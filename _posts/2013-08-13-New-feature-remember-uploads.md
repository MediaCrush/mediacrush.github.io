    New Feature: Remember Uploads
layout: post
---

You may have noticed that we recently added a new feature: remembering your uploads. From this point on, if you upload a
file, your computer will remember that you uploaded it. This is important - we do not store your uploads on our servers,
it's all stored on your own computer. This keeps your uploads private. If you do not want to remember them anyway, that's
fine, too. You can disable this feature at any time. You are also able to remove specific items from your history, or
clear it all out at once.

[Upload some stuff](https://mediacru.sh), then head over to [your history](https://mediacru.sh/mine) to check it out!

This also brings a new feature to the table: the ability to delete your files after uploading them. You can not only
remove items from your history on that page, but remove them from MediaCrush entirely. You can only do this from the
computer you originally uploaded the file from, though!
