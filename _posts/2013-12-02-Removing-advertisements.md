title: Removing Advertisements
layout: post

Earlier today, we removed all advertising from MediaCrush. We were issued a notice by AdSense
telling us that our site was a violation of their terms by showing ads alongside mature content
uploaded by our users. Rather than remove the offending content, we decided to re-evaluate our
use of AdSense in the first place.

We realized that
[we aren't getting much money out of ads anyway](/2013/12/01/Transparency-reports.html)
(less than 25% of our monthly operating costs are covered by AdSense). Additionally, we
dislike the implications our use of AdSense has on user privacy. We have decided to remove
advertising from the site entirely.

The benefit of this is that you can now browse MediaCrush completely ad-free, without even
having to opt-out. Your privacy is also better served by our removal of AdSense. If you'd like
to help us make ends meet without ads, please head over to the
[donation page](https://mediacru.sh/donate) to help out.

We are working on a commercial offering (don't worry, we won't sell any features free users
can't have). Hopefully this will help us recover our operating expenses. We also may later
re-implement advertising in a more liberal and privacy-centric fashion. Until then, we're
still just happy to have you around.

As always, thanks for using MediaCrush and enjoy your ad-free experience!
