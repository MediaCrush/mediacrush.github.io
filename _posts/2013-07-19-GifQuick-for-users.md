We're getting ready to launch GifQuick soon, and wanted to drop a quick post here to show you around the place. By the time you
read this, we'll probably already have "launched" properly. So, let's get you acquainted with the site.
[GifQuick](https://gifquick.net) is an image hosting site. There are many such sites, but GifQuick is made unique by its speed.
Most importantly (as the name would imply), GifQuick serves up gifs super fast, through the magic of video.

<div class="row">
    <div class="left">
        <h3>GIF</h3>
        <img src="https://gifquick.net/static/demo.gif" alt="GIF demo" />
        <p>Filesize: 1965 kB (~2.0 MB)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <h3>Video</h3>
        <video autoplay loop>
            <source src="https://gifquick.net/static/demo.mp4" type='video/mp4'></source>
            <source src="https://gifquick.net/static/demo.ogv" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora,vorbis"'></source>
        </video>
        <p>Filesize: 118 kB (~0.118 MB)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="clearfix"></div>
</div>

The results? **1600% compression**. That's exactly right, the video shown here loads 1600% faster than the gif. And we often
get speeds even better. Hell, I've [seen ones](https://gifquick.net/Qq-sLq4otwN_) more than 3000%. You see, the gif file format
is pretty bad. In the 28 years since GIF was created, we've made huge strides in video compression. So, in order to give you
gifs faster, we convert them to videos. Pretty neat, huh?

Not only are we super fast for gifs, we've put a huge pipe on our beefy servers, and we run PNG and JPG files through lossless
compression to serve them faster, too. We also do a lot of things that you might like that are unrelated to our images:

* You can use our site totally anonymously
* All connections to https://gifquick.net are encrypted
* We couldn't give the NSA (or anyone else) your private info, even if we wanted to

There's more details on privacy and such in the sister blog post, [GifQuick for Nerds](/2013/07/19/GifQuick-for-nerds.html).

In short: GifQuick is a super-fast, super-sleek image host that takes every step to defend your privacy. We're also totally
free (we even let you disable advertisements), and we love our users. What are you waiting for?

a great big hug the next time you see him.
