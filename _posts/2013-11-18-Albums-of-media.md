After a bunch of work last week, we're proud to reveal our latest feature: albums! It's now
possible to use MediaCrush to create albums of HTML5'd gifs, images, videos, and audio to
share with your friends.

<div class="mediacrush" data-media="29266380d26b"></div>

It's easy to use. Just [upload files](https://mediacru.sh) like usual and click on "create
album" once you've uploaded at least two. Albums can also be embedded like other media can,
as you can see above this text. Let us know what you think on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mediacru_sh) or [Reddit](https://pay.reddit.com/r/mediacrush),
or just as a comment on this post. Thanks for using MediaCrush!
