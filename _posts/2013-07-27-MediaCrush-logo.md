title: MediaCrush Logo
---

[NSDex](https://github.com/NSDex) has graciously offered us a logo! I was about to go find
and pay a designer, but he was nice enough to give us this great logo for free. In the past
he also made logos for a few of my other open source projects.

So, the usage of this logo is simple: do whatever you want with it, so long as it's not
commercial. For commercial ventures, [email us](mailto:support@mediacru.sh) to get permission
first.

Here's a vector:
