One million visitors!

<a href="https://xkcd.com/570/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/new_car.png" /></a>

As of April 2014, MediaCrush has served over one million unique users! Thank you so much for using
MediaCrush, we've had loads of fun making it and we're glad that you all like it so much. I'm
Drew DeVault (aka SirCmpwn), one of the two minds behind MediaCrush. My friend Jose Diez (jdiez)
and I started working on MediaCrush
[9 months ago](https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush/commit/c733cf535ffd30f8d99deae72e0b6750f80765f6)
after a quick little chat:

    <SirCmpwn> I'm thinking of making a website for hosting gifs
    <SirCmpwn> but when you upload a gif, it converts it to ogv and renders it with HTML5 video
    <SirCmpwn> faster load time + better quality
    <jdiez> hmmmm
    <jdiez> sounds like a great idea
    <SirCmpwn> I bought gifquick.com
    <SirCmpwn> .net
    <jdiez> not one of your best names
    <SirCmpwn> you're a name

Of course, we got a name that didn't suck (as much), and we've grown quite a bit more than
our original vision. We decided that the world needed an open-source, privacy-first place to
host videos, audio, and images. Hell, at first, I just wanted a place to host my own stuff -
but why not make it available to the world?

Here's a quick little history of what we've done since then, for nostalgia's sake.

* 2013-07-12: We start working on a simple little open-source website

* A bunch of other stuff, there have been 1652 changes and I got tired of reading them

We really do appreciate all that you guys have done to support us. I'm glad to have been a
part of MediaCrush, and I look forward to serving you all in the future. And of course,
thanks to [Kevin Granger](https://twitter.com/Kevin_Granger), who built this wonderful
confetti thingy - without which, this blog post would be lame.

Now, to hold up to the principles we were founded on - this month's transparency reports
are ready.

This month, we added [Gittip](https://gittip.com/mediacrush) to our list of services you
can donate with. However, we haven't yet sorted out all the issues with actually getting
money from them, so they won't be included in this month's reporting. That being said,
we're very optimistic about it - we currently stand to earn more donations from Gittip
than from any other source.

Speaking of donations, we'd love to get some help with our ever-growing costs. For example,
we recently saw our highest day of traffic ever: 219,109 unique people visited the site,
not counting those who set [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us), or those connecting through
the API (hello, RES users!). To put that into a financial context, that day alone cost us
about $120 in CDN costs. [You can help!](https://mediacru.sh/donate)

Without further ado, however, here are today's reports. Interesting reports are shown in
bold.
