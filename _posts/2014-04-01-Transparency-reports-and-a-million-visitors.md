One million visitors!

<a href="https://xkcd.com/570/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/new_car.png" /></a>

As of April 2014, MediaCrush has served over one million unique users! Thank you so much for using
MediaCrush, we've had loads of fun making it and we're glad that you all like it so much. I'm
Drew DeVault (aka SirCmpwn), one of the two minds behind MediaCrush. My friend Jose Diez (jdiez)
and I started working on MediaCrush
[9 months ago](https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush/commit/c733cf535ffd30f8d99deae72e0b6750f80765f6)
after a quick little chat:

    <SirCmpwn> I'm thinking of making a website for hosting gifs
    <SirCmpwn> but when you upload a gif, it converts it to ogv and renders it with HTML5 video
    <SirCmpwn> faster load time + better quality
    <jdiez> hmmmm
    <jdiez> sounds like a great idea
    <SirCmpwn> I bought gifquick.com
    <SirCmpwn> .net
    <jdiez> not one of your best names
    <SirCmpwn> you're a name

Of course, we got a name that didn't suck (as much), and we've grown quite a bit more than
our original vision. We decided that the world needed an open-source, privacy-first place to
host videos, audio, and images. Hell, at first, I just wanted a place to host my own stuff -
but why not make it available to the world?

Here's a quick little history of what we've done since then, for nostalgia's sake.

We really do appreciate all that you guys have done to support us. I'm glad to have been a
part of MediaCrush, and I look forward to serving you all in the future. And of course,
thanks to [Kevin Granger](http://codepen.io/Shipow/pen/cEgiu), who built this wonderful
confetti thingy - without which, this blog post would be lame.

Now, to hold up to the principles we were founded on - this month's transparency reports
are ready.
