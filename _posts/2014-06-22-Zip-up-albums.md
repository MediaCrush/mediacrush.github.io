Starting today, you're able to request zip files of albums. Hit the "Download
Album" button on any album page to request a zip file, which may take a couple of
minutes to put together. If you aren't the first person to ask for a zip of that
album, then you'll just get it right away.

Thanks again for flying MediaCrush!
