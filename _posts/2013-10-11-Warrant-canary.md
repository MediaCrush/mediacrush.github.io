title: Warrant Canary

In an effort to maintain our promise to ensure your privacy, we have started putting up a warrant canary, available [here](https://mediacru.sh/transparency/warrant-canary.txt).

The public key with which it's signed can be found [here](https://mediacru.sh/transparency/public-key.txt). For your convenience, we have put up a version of the warrant canary on its own at [this address](https://mediacru.sh/transparency/warrant-canary.signed.txt).

This idea was first implemented by [rsync.net](http://rsync.net/). It is not foolproof, but at the end of the day it adds one more layer of protection on top of the technical solutions discussed in our [serious page](https://mediacru.sh/serious).
