**tl;dr**: [MediaCrush](https://mediacru.sh) hosts images, video, and audio for you and takes your privacy seriously. It's
like imgur or minus, plus videos and audio, plus privacy.

MediaCrush is an image hosting site. There are many such sites, but MediaCrush is made unique by its speed
and its commitment to user privacy. For example, MediaCrush serves up gifs *way* faster than other sites:

<div class="row">
    <div class="left">
        <h3>GIF</h3>
        <img src="https://mediacru.sh/static/demo.gif" alt="GIF demo" />
        <p>Filesize: 1965 kB (~2.0 MB)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right">
        <h3>Video</h3>
        <video autoplay loop>
            <source src="https://mediacru.sh/static/demo.mp4" type='video/mp4'></source>
            <source src="https://mediacru.sh/static/demo.ogv" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora,vorbis"'></source>
        </video>
        <p>Filesize: 118 kB (~0.118 MB)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="clearfix"></div>
</div>

The results? **1600% compression**. That's exactly right, the video shown here loads 1600% faster than the gif. And we often
get speeds even better. Hell, I've [seen ones](https://mediacru.sh/Qq-sLq4otwN_) more than 3000%. You see, the gif file format
is pretty bad. In the 28 years since GIF was created, we've made huge strides in video compression. So, in order to give you
gifs faster, we convert them to videos. Pretty neat, huh?

Not only are we super fast for gifs, we've invested in powerful servers and a ton of bandwidth*, and we run other files
through lossless compression tools to serve them faster, too. We also do a lot of things that you might like that are
unrelated to our images:

* You can use our site totally anonymously
* All connections to [https://mediacru.sh](https://mediacru.sh) are encrypted
* We couldn't give the NSA (or anyone else) your private info, even if we wanted to
* Ads are completely optional, you can opt out and never see them again

There's more details on privacy and such in the sister blog post, [MediaCrush for Nerds](/2013/07/19/MediaCrush-for-nerds.html).

In short: MediaCrush is a super-fast, super-sleek image host that takes every step to defend your privacy. We're also totally
free (we even let you disable advertisements), and we love our users. What are you waiting for?
