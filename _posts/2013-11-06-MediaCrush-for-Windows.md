We're proud to release **MediaCrush for Windows** to the general public. It's a handy little program that helps you Windows users
more easily upload media to our site. It also includes a nice screenshot tool that will take a screenshot and upload it straight to
MediaCrush, no extra hassle. If that sounds like your cup of tea, grab
[the latest version](https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush-Windows/releases/download/1.0.0/MediaCrush.exe) and upload away!

Not on Windows? Hey, no worries. We've got a mobile site, a [Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mediacrush/),
a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mediacrush/efbojpedpjjpppahkknegfblpdliiple),
and a [bash script](https://github.com/MediaCrush/MediaCrush-cli), too! And of course, you can always just
[upload directly from your web browser](https://mediacru.sh). We're working on even more ways to use
MediaCrush, so sit tight if you're not covered yet.

MediaCrush for Windows is completely open source, too. You can browse and contribute to the source code
